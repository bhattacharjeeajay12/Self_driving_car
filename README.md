# Problem Statement

The problem statement is to build a Self-Driving car. For learning and for the simplicity of training, we are using a small dataset of 2.3 GB. The dataset has been taken from : https://github.com/SullyChen/Autopilot-TensorFlow . Lot of thanks to Sully Chen for providing this dataset.

In the dataset sully has provided dataset containg 45000 images with steering wheel angles.
